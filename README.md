# Userstyles

A collection of custom userstyles on various sites that I use.

## Install

Firstly ensure you have a usercss extension installed for your browser. Stylus is recommended:
To install:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

To find a userstyle, search for a website in the [styles](https://github.com/appcreatorguy/userstyles/tree/main/styles/) folder.
To install a userstyle open the `.user.css` file and click on the `Raw` button on the top right hand side.
Customise the settings for the colors and fonts to your liking, and then click on `Install style` on the left sidebar.
